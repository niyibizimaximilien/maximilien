# we need to know github basic commands used while in collaboration with peaple.

the best thing you need to know is that when you start a project 

# git init => this is about to help the gitbash in your laptop to access the files you write in that folder where you want github to track.
when you type git init then the git will then add a .git folder in your working folder. this is where all the codes you write, the changes, additions, deletions,...etc.

the next thing after allowing the git initialisation in your project folder is to make sure that the place where you want to put the codes from your local computer to the public (online) so that other peaple can easly access it. 

# make the github repository as the normal ways: 
![like in this image](image.png)

# git remote add orgin <<repo-name>>
 ========================================

 # the above steps are followed when you start your project manually on your local computer. if you already had a repo on you own github you can just write: 

# git clone <the-link>
